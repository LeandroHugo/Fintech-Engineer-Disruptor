## Project Background 💡

Congratulations! As a recently promoted fintech engineer at one of the world's top five banks, you have an exciting task ahead of you. You're to lead the development of a groundbreaking decentralized finance system - a blockchain-based ledger, along with a user-friendly web interface. This will allow partner banks to carry out and validate financial transactions with impeccable integrity.

## Project Aim 🎯

In this project, we'll update the given Python file to include:

1. A new `Record` data class which will serve as the template for the financial transaction records stored in the ledger's blocks.
2. An updated `Block` data class where the generic `data` attribute is replaced with a `record` attribute of type `Record`.
3. User input areas in the Streamlit application to gather relevant information for each financial record stored in the PyChain ledger.
4. Finally, we'll test the completed PyChain ledger.

## Instructions 📝

### Step 1: Create a Record Data Class 👩‍💻

You'll define a new Python data class named `Record`. This class will have a structured form consisting of `sender`, `receiver`, and `amount` attributes. 

### Step 2: Modify the Existing Block Data Class to Store Record Data ⚙️

You'll update the `Block` class by renaming the `data` attribute to `record` and set it to use an instance of the `Record` class created in Step 1.

### Step 3: Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit Interface 🖥️

You'll code additional input areas for your Streamlit application's user interface. These input areas will capture the sender, receiver, and amount for each transaction that will be stored in the Block record. 

### Step 4: Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records 🧪

Finally, you'll test your completed PyChain ledger and user interface. Run your Streamlit application, store some mined blocks in your PyChain ledger, and validate the blockchain process using your PyChain ledger. Don't forget to take screenshots of the blockchain validation process, including multiple blocks in the ledger.

## What to expect 🕵️

The final product will be a user-friendly web application that will allow financial transactions to be carried out and verified seamlessly. 

Your README.md file will include an explanation of the Streamlit application, screenshots or videos of the deployed Streamlit application, and any other information needed to interact with your project.

This is a cutting-edge fintech project, and we are excited to see you shine as you develop it! Good luck and happy coding! 🚀💻
